# py_GTA5
Explorations of Using Python to play Grand Theft Auto 5, mainly for the purposes of creating self-driving cars and other vehicles.
We read frames directly from the desktop, rather than working with the game's code itself. This means it works with more games than just GTA V, and it will basically learn (well, attempt to learn...) whatever you put in front of it based on the frames as input and key presses as output.
I upload the coades about Curriculum Project.
The code can be used for learning artificial intelligence in a game called Grand Theft Auto 5.
While I was looking for the contents of professional books and writing the AI development codes, I referred to the open source to study by myself.
I uploaded my own code and quoted open source code.
Then, have fun coding.
:D

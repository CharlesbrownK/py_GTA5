Explorations of Using Python to play Grand Theft Auto 5
I upload the coades about Curriculum Project.
The code can be used for learning artificial intelligence in a game called Grand Theft Auto 5.
While I was looking for the contents of professional books and writing the AI development codes, I referred to the open source to study by myself.
I uploaded my own code and quoted open source code.
Then, have fun coding.
:D
